<h3>It seems like everyone wants to be an NBA star. With all the fame, glitz, glamour, and let's not forget…
    the money! But what does it take to make the kinda doe NBA stars pull? Let's dive into what kind of stats
    you would need to put up to make the big bucks in the NBA.</h3>
<h2>Let's first take a look at salaries spent by the league.</h2>
<div id='league_section'>
<h3>Here are some examinations of player salaries and total league salaries adjusted for inflation:</h3>

height='525' width=80%></iframe>
<iframe id='nba_league' scrolling='no' style='border:none;' seamless='seamless' src='https://joseph-maulin.github.io/nba_league.html'
height='525' width=80%></iframe>
<h3>As you can see the total salary expenditures from teams has skyrocketed in the last few years by about 2.5x from 1996 to 2018 with inflation.
    Just from the 2014–15 season to the 2019–20 season, the salary cap rose from $63.1 million to $109.140 million.
    This means that now more than ever are teams dishing out huge contracts to players. So just by being a player in today's league you are off to a great start.</h3>
</div>
<h2>What about teams?</h2>
<iframe id='nba_expenditures' scrolling='no' style='border:none;' seamless='seamless' src='https://joseph-maulin.github.io/nba_expenditures.html'
height='525' width=80%></iframe>
<h3>Overall the amount spent per year for each NBA franchise has been somewhat similar when adjusted for inflation. New Orleans is higher since the initial team the New Orleans Hornets was founded in 2002.
    <br><br>The highest paid seasons, even adjusted for inflation, are all in the last year of the data-set analyzed for this article, the 2017–18 season.
    All paying well into the luxury tax. This reflects the escalation of salary payouts in the NBA as well as the value of players overall rising significantly.</h3>

<h2>But what stats lead to higher paid salaries?</h2>
<h3>Now that we have looked into teams and the league, let's look into what kind of production a player needs in order to make top-tier salaries in the NBA.</h3>
<iframe id='nba_salary_age' scrolling='no' style='border:none;' seamless='seamless' src='https://joseph-maulin.github.io/nba_salary_age.html'
    height='525' width=80%></iframe>
<br>
<h3>Age vs Salary is distributed fairly normally. After about the age of 34 there is noticeable drop in what teams are willing to pay players.
  <br><br>After running a player stats through a KMeans clustering, players can be broken out into 4 groups based on a NBA tracked stats.
  <br><br>Notable stats to take away from the groupings are that a players in cluster 3, which had a substantial amount of the highest paid players at 84%, are these:</h3>
<ul id='stats_list'>
<li>Age: 27.05</li>
<li>Position: 2.39 or between Shooting Guard and Small Forward</li>
<li>PPG: 20.02</li>
<li>RPG: 5.98</li>
<li>APG: 5.02</li>
<li>True Shooting: 56.39%</li>
<li>Box Plus/Minus: 4.073</li>
<li>Usage: 25.39%</li>
<li>Win Shares: 9.29</li>
<li>Value/Shot: 0.274</li>
</ul>

    height='525' width=80%></iframe>
<h2>Some Interesting Take-A-Ways:</h2>
<h3>Overall, it would seem to be pretty straightforward as to what kind of player should make top-tier salary, but sometimes you get some notably overpaid or underpaid players.
<br><br>For example, let's take Kawhi Leonard in 2013–14 season. He was in cluster 3 with stats correlating with the top tier players and won Finals MVP that year. He was paid only 3.15 million. What an unbelievable bargain!
<br><br>Another example would be Draymond Green in 2014–15. That year Draymond put up 11.7 pts, 8.2 rbs, and 3.7 ast. Those look like middle of the road numbers, but if you look deeper you see he has a 16.4 PER, 8.5 Win Shares,
    and a Defensive Box Plus Minus of 4.0. This leads to his reputation as a force multiplier for Golden State. He was a very underrated and underpaid player of only $997,614 as a very import piece of a championship run.
<br><br>Lastly,  Kobe Bryant in 2013–14. He was in cluster group 1, a low-mid player. However, that year Kobe had a knee injury early in the season and only played 6 games. His stats that year would suggest
    he was vastly overpaid, but that would still be a top-tier player next season.
<br><br>In conclusion, it seems when going through the data that players are paid more if they have more of the spotlight. Higher contributors to the sexy stats like scoring seem to have a much
    more weighted impact on payouts than what true value would dictate.</h3>
